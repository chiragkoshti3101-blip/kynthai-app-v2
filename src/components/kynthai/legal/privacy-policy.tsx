          consumer privacy laws, including the FTC Health Breach Notification
          Rule and state consumer health privacy laws, and we apply strong
          safeguards to your sensitive health data.

      <SectionTitle icon={Database}>1. Data we collect</SectionTitle>
      <p>We collect only the data necessary to operate Kynthai for you and your family:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> name, email address, phone number (optional), hashed password (bcrypt), and chosen portal (Family / Patient / Doctor / Lab / Admin).</li>
        <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> family-member profiles you create, including name, relationship, age, and notes.</li>
        <li><strong>Health data (special category):</strong> medication names, dosages, schedules, reminder logs, symptom-analyzer inputs, AI chat messages, uploaded prescription and medicine images, chronic conditions, and lab results.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> device type, app version, IP address (country-level only), feature usage events, and crash logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication data:</strong> records of consults with doctors, lab orders, and prescription invitations.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment data:</strong> billing email and subscription tier. Card data is handled entirely by our payment processor (Stripe) — we never see or store your full card number.</li>
      </ul>


      <SectionTitle icon={Globe}>2. How we use sensitive health data</SectionTitle>
      <p>Kynthai is not a HIPAA-covered entity or business associate. We process sensitive health data only for the purposes described below, based on your consent and the operation of the service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> — we process sensitive health data for the features you use, with free, specific, informed consent. You may withdraw consent at any time via the in-app consent manager or by emailing <ContactEmail address="privacy@kynthai.app" className="text-emerald-600 underline" />.</li>
        <li><strong>To provide the service:</strong> — to deliver the Kynthai service you signed up for, including medication reminders, AI features, doctor consults, and lab orders.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> — to comply with applicable US federal and state laws, including tax and record-retention requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> — to send emergency SOS alerts to caretakers and linked doctors when your health or safety is at risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> — for security, fraud prevention, and product improvement, balanced against your privacy rights.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For any use of sensitive health data beyond the purposes described above, we will ask for your explicit consent first. Withdrawing consent does not affect processing that was completed before the withdrawal.</p>

      <SectionTitle icon={ShieldCheck}>3. US privacy compliance</SectionTitle>
      <p>Kynthai operates in the United States and follows applicable US federal and state privacy laws for consumer health data. Kynthai is not a HIPAA-covered entity or business associate and does not claim HIPAA compliance. Our commitments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We use and disclose your sensitive health data only for the purposes described in this policy, with strict purpose limitation and data minimization.</li>
        <li>We obtain your explicit consent before using or disclosing sensitive health data for purposes beyond providing the service, and we summarize our privacy practices at account registration.</li>
        <li>You have the right to access, correct, amend, and delete your data, and to designate an authorized individual to act on your behalf in the event of death or incapacity.</li>
        <li>In the event of a breach of unsecured sensitive health data, we will notify affected individuals and, where required, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and applicable state regulators, without unreasonable delay — in no case later than 60 calendar days from discovery (consistent with the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule).</li>
        <li>Health data is treated as sensitive consumer health data and is protected with strong security controls.</li>
        <li>A Privacy Officer (details in Section 18) handles privacy complaints. Complaints are acknowledged within 5 business days. Standard grievances are resolved within 30 days; complex investigations are extended in writing with stated resolution timelines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For users in the United States, applicable federal and state consumer privacy laws govern our practices. California residents are additionally protected by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). Washington, Nevada, and other states with consumer health privacy laws grant additional rights described in this policy. For users in other jurisdictions, Kynthai complies with applicable local data protection laws to the extent required.</p>

      <SectionTitle icon={ShieldCheck}>4. US privacy authorization & privacy practices</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        At registration, you are presented with our privacy practices and asked to consent to the processing of your data. For uses of sensitive health data beyond providing the service, we obtain your separate, specific consent. AI features may require a separate optional data-use consent. You may revoke any consent at any time via your account settings or by emailing <strong><ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" /></strong>. Revocation takes effect promptly (typically within 72 hours) but does not apply to processing that occurred before the revocation. Withdrawing AI consent disables AI features but retains your medication reminders and health records.
      </p>


      <SectionTitle icon={UserCheck}>5. Your privacy rights — how to exercise</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Under applicable US federal and state privacy laws — including the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule, state consumer health privacy laws (e.g., Washington&apos;s My Health My Data Act), and — for California residents — the CCPA/CPRA, you have the following rights:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> — Export all your data via Profile → Export Data (GET /api/user/data-export). You will receive a JSON file within 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to correction:</strong> — Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete sensitive health data via your profile settings or by emailing <ContactEmail address="privacy@kynthai.app" className="text-emerald-600 underline" />.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to request restrictions:</strong> — Request restrictions on how your sensitive health data is used and shared, subject to applicable limitations.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to delete account:</strong> — You may delete your account and all associated sensitive health data at any time via Profile → Delete Account (DELETE /api/user/account). A 7-day cooldown applies.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy complaints:</strong> — File a complaint with our Privacy Officer at <strong><ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" /></strong>. We acknowledge within 5 business days and resolve within 30 days. You may also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at <strong>ftc.gov/complaint</strong> or with your state attorney general.</li>
        <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> — Unresolved complaints may be escalated to the FTC or your state attorney general.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to designate an authorized representative:</strong> — Designate an authorized individual to act on your behalf in the event of death or incapacity. Email <strong><ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" /></strong> to set up.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including the right to know, delete, and opt out of the sale of personal information. We do not sell your personal information. We will respond to valid requests within 30 days (extendable by 30 days for complex requests, with notice).
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={Ban}>6. Your rights regarding health data</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai treats health data as <strong>sensitive consumer health data</strong> protected under
        applicable US federal and state privacy law. The following safeguards apply:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sensitive health data is used and disclosed only for the purposes described in this policy, or with your explicit consent for anything beyond those purposes.</li>
        <li>You may request access to, amendment of, or restrictions on the use and disclosure of your health data (sensitive health data) at any time.</li>
        <li>Health data is encrypted in transit with TLS 1.3; uploaded documents and prescription images are additionally encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.</li>
        <li>Access to health data is restricted to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis.</li>
        <li>Audit logs record all access to health data for security and compliance review.</li>
        <li>In the event of a breach involving unsecured sensitive health data, we will notify affected individuals and, where required, the FTC and applicable state regulators, without unreasonable delay — in no case later than 60 calendar days from discovery (consistent with the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        US users are protected by applicable US federal and state consumer privacy laws. California residents have CCPA/CPRA rights. Users in other jurisdictions retain rights under applicable local privacy laws to the extent required.
      </p>

      {/* State privacy law section */}
      <SectionTitle icon={Scale}>6A. Other US state consumer privacy laws</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        In addition to US privacy and CCPA/CPRA, Kynthai complies with the following state-level privacy statutes that grant consumers rights over their personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virginia — Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA):</strong> Virginia residents have the right to confirm whether we process their personal data, correct inaccuracies, delete their personal data, obtain a copy of their personal data in a portable format, and opt out of the processing of personal data for targeted advertising or sale. You may exercise these rights by contacting <ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" />.</li>
        <li><strong>Colorado — Privacy Act (CPA):</strong> Colorado residents have the right to know what personal data is collected, correct inaccuracies, delete personal data, obtain a copy of their data, and opt out of targeted advertising, profiling, or sale. To exercise these rights, submit a request to <ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" />.</li>
        <li><strong>Utah — Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA):</strong> Utah residents may request confirmation of data processing, access to their data, correction of inaccuracies, and deletion of their data. Opt-out rights apply to targeted advertising and sale. Submit requests to <ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" />.</li>
        <li><strong>Connecticut — Data Privacy Act (CTDPA):</strong> Connecticut residents have the right to confirm processing, access their data, correct inaccuracies, delete personal data, and opt out of targeted advertising or sale. Requests may be submitted to <ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" />.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Nondiscrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights under these laws.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={Clock}>7. Data retention</SectionTitle>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active accounts:</strong> for the duration of your subscription or until you delete your account.</li>
        <li><strong>After account deletion:</strong> we erase personal data within 30 days, except where retention is required by law (tax retention under US federal law: 7 years for tax records).</li>
        <li><strong>De-identified data:</strong> information from which direct identifiers have been removed may be retained indefinitely, as it no longer constitutes personal or sensitive health data.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> encrypted backups may contain deleted data for up to 90 days for disaster recovery, after which they are permanently purged.</li>
      </ul>

      <SectionTitle icon={Lock}>8. Security</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        We implement layered technical and organisational controls appropriate
        to the sensitivity of the data we process.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All API and web traffic is protected with TLS 1.3.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption at rest for high-sensitivity data:</strong> Government-issued identity fields are encrypted with AES-256-GCM (256-bit key, 128-bit IV, 128-bit authentication tag) before being written. Data is decrypted only when required for a specific authorised operation.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption at rest — general health data:</strong> Column-level encryption for general health columns (medications, lab results, AI chat logs, prescription images) is being rolled out. This will mirror the approach for identity fields. We will update this policy once rollout is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Password storage:</strong> Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12).</li>
        <li><strong>Session tokens:</strong> Authentication sessions use HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookies. Session tokens are HMAC-SHA256 hashed before storage. Session TTL is 30 days from last activity; if fewer than 7 days remain it is automatically extended. Password reset tokens expire after 30 minutes. You can end all sessions by logging out or changing your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Access control:</strong> Role-based access control restricts data access to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Audit logging:</strong> All access to health data is logged for security and compliance review.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate limiting:</strong> API rate limits are enforced to prevent abuse and credential-stuffing attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Content-Security-Policy:</strong> CSP headers are applied to reduce injection risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Account lockout:</strong> Repeated failed login attempts result in temporary account lockout.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Access to production systems is restricted to authorised personnel. We
        follow secure deployment practices and review our infrastructure
        configurations regularly.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={Stethoscope}>8A. FDA Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) & platform status</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        <strong>Kynthai is not a medical device.</strong> Kynthai is a health-technology
        platform that provides general wellness and health-management tools
        (medication reminders, appointment scheduling, lab bookings, prescription
        management, AI chat, symptom analysis, medicine identification, drug-interaction
        checking, and health insights). These features provide informational content
        only and do <strong>not</strong> constitute medical advice, diagnosis,
        treatment, or a substitute for professional healthcare under applicable
        federal and state law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because our AI features are not intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat,
        or prevent disease, they are <strong>not</strong> regulated as Software as a
        Medical Device (SaMD) under 21 CFR Part 870, nor do they require FDA 510(k)
        clearance, De Novo classification, or PMA approval. Kynthai makes no claims
        of FDA clearance or approval for diagnostic, therapeutic, or monitoring
        functions. The FDA may regulate health software in the future; Kynthai will
        comply with any applicable FDA requirements as they develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Independent healthcare professionals:</strong> Doctors and labs
        available through Kynthai are independent healthcare providers. Kynthai does
        not employ, supervise, or control their medical decision-making. These
        professionals are solely responsible for compliance with applicable federal
        and state healthcare laws, including but not limited to EMTALA, Medicare/Medicaid
        conditions of participation, and state medical-board regulations.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={Globe}>9. Data storage & cross-border transfers</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        <strong>Data storage:</strong> sensitive health data of
        US users is stored and processed on secure cloud infrastructure
        with data-processing agreements in place with all subprocessors
        that handle sensitive health data. Cross-border data transfers (where applicable) are
        subject to appropriate safeguards (data-protection terms and Standard Contractual
        Clauses) to ensure continued comprehensive protection of sensitive health data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kynthai may transfer data to cloud service providers and subprocessors
        operating outside the United States for data processing purposes. Such transfers are
        protected by appropriate contractual safeguards including standard data
        protection clauses and encryption in transit and at rest.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={ShieldCheck}>10. Your rights (US)</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        As a user whose sensitive health data is held by Kynthai, you have the following rights under applicable US federal and state law:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> Request a copy of your sensitive health data. Use Profile → Export Data (GET /api/user/data-export). Delivery within 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete sensitive health data via your profile settings or email to <ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" />.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to request restrictions:</strong> Request restrictions on how your sensitive health data is used and shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to delete account:</strong> You may delete your account and all associated sensitive health data at any time via Profile → Delete Account (DELETE /api/user/account). A 7-day cooldown applies before permanent deletion.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy complaints:</strong> File a complaint with our Privacy Officer at <ContactEmailText address="privacy@kynthai.app" />. We acknowledge within 5 business days and resolve within 30 days. You may also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (ftc.gov/complaint) or your state attorney general.</li>
        <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> Unresolved complaints may be escalated to the FTC or your state attorney general.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including the right to know, delete, and opt out of the sale of personal information. We do not sell your personal information. California residents have rights under CCPA/CPRA (we do not sell personal info). Other jurisdictions: you may also have additional rights under applicable laws in your jurisdiction. We will respond to valid
        requests within 30 days (extendable by 30 days for complex requests, with
        notice).
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={Ban}>11. Your rights regarding health data</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai treats health data as <strong>sensitive consumer health data</strong> protected under
        applicable US federal and state privacy law. We apply heightened safeguards:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sensitive health data is used and disclosed only for the purposes described in this policy, or with your explicit consent for anything beyond those purposes.</li>
        <li>You may request access to, amendment of, or restrictions on the use and disclosure of your health data (sensitive health data) at any time.</li>
        <li>Health data is encrypted in transit with TLS 1.3; uploaded documents and prescription images are additionally encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.</li>
        <li>Access to health data is restricted to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis.</li>
        <li>Audit logs record all access to health data for security and compliance review.</li>
        <li>In the event of a breach involving unsecured sensitive health data, we will notify affected individuals and, where required, the FTC and applicable state regulators, without unreasonable delay — in no case later than 60 calendar days from discovery (consistent with the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        US users are protected by applicable US federal and state consumer privacy laws. California residents are additionally protected by the CCPA/CPRA. Users in other jurisdictions retain rights under applicable local privacy laws to the extent required.
      </p>


      <SectionTitle icon={AlertTriangle}>12. Data sharing & subprocessors</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai shares personal data only with the minimum number of processors
        necessary to deliver the service. Each sub-processor listed below has
        executed (or in the case of open-source components, is covered by) a
        data-processing agreement imposing obligations no less protective than

      <p>Kynthai is not directed at children under 16. Family profiles for minors may be created and managed by a parent or legal guardian who consents to the processing on the child&apos;s behalf. The parent may request deletion of a minor&apos;s profile at any time. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 16 without verified parental consent, consistent with the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506) and applicable US child-protection framework.

      <p>
        Kynthai is a consumer health application, not a HIPAA covered entity or
        business associate, so we are not subject to the HIPAA/HITECH breach
        notification rules. We nevertheless take breach response seriously and,
        as a provider of health-related personal data, we follow the Federal Trade
        Commission&apos;s Health Breach Notification Rule (16 CFR Part 318) to the
        extent it applies, along with any applicable state consumer health
        privacy laws:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Affected individuals:</strong> We will notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay, and in no case later than 60 calendar days from discovery, when their unsecured sensitive health data is acquired in a breach.</li>
        <li><strong>FTC notification:</strong> Where required by the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule (16 CFR Part 318), we will notify the Federal Trade Commission, and prominent media where the breach affects 500 or more individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Remediation & review:</strong> We will contain the breach, assess its scope, take reasonable steps to prevent recurrence, and conduct a post-incident review within 30 days.</li>
      </ul>


      <SectionTitle icon={Bell}>16. Automated decision-making & AI transparency</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai uses AI to provide health information, identify medicines, check drug
        interactions, and offer insights. AI outputs are advisory only and do not
        constitute medical advice. You always have the option to consult a qualified
        healthcare professional through Kynthai.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>AI Incident Reporting:</strong> If you believe an AI response was
        incorrect, misleading, or potentially harmful, report it immediately to
        <strong><ContactEmailText address="ai-incidents@kynthai.app" /></strong>. Include the AI feature used, the
        query/input, and the output received. We review all reports, track patterns,
        and use findings to improve AI accuracy. All reports are logged and reviewed
        within 72 hours.
      </p>
      <p>Kynthai uses AI (large language models, vision models, speech recognition) for chat, symptom analysis, medicine identification, prescription scanning, drug-interaction checking, and insights. These features provide <strong>advisory information only</strong> and do not make automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects about you. All AI outputs are clearly labelled as AI-generated, and a qualified healthcare professional should be consulted before making medical decisions. You may request human review of any AI-generated output by contacting your doctor or <ContactEmail address="hello@kynthai.app" className="text-emerald-600 underline" />.</p>

        All doctors, healthcare professionals, and labs available through Kynthai

      <ul>
        <li>Any consultation, diagnosis, treatment plan, prescription, or medical
        advice you receive comes solely from the independent doctor, not from

        <li>Kynthai&apos;s role is limited to providing the technology

        <strong>Professional indemnity insurance required.</strong> All doctors
        and healthcare professionals using Kynthai <strong>must</strong> maintain

        full scope of services they provide through the platform. By registering
        as a doctor on Kynthai, you represent and warrant that you hold valid
        professional indemnity insurance and will maintain it throughout your use
        of the platform. Kynthai reserves the right to request proof of insurance
        at any time and to suspend or remove any doctor who fails to provide
        evidence of valid coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No vicarious liability.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted
        by applicable law, Kynthai shall not be held vicariously liable for the
        acts, omissions, negligence, or malpractice of any doctor, healthcare
        professional, or lab using the platform. Any claim arising from medical
        services must be directed to the treating doctor or their insurer.
        Kynthai shall not be named as a party to any dispute between a patient
        and a doctor, and Kynthai will not indemnify or compensate any party for
        damages arising from a doctor&apos;s medical practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mandatory patient acknowledgment required.</strong> Before any
        consultation booking is confirmed, every patient must explicitly
        acknowledge and agree through Kynthai&apos;s mandatory liability
        acknowledgment screen that (a) Kynthai is a technology platform only and
        not a healthcare provider, (b) the doctor is an independent practitioner
        solely responsible for their own medical advice and treatment, and
        (c) Kynthai is not liable for any medical negligence, misdiagnosis, or
        incorrect treatment by the doctor. No booking is processed without this
        explicit patient consent.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={UserX}>7. Doctor removal on complaint</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai reserves the right to <strong>immediately suspend or permanently
        remove</strong> any doctor or healthcare professional from the platform,
        without prior notice, upon receiving a credible complaint regarding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical negligence, malpractice, or provision of false consultation.</li>
        <li>Practising without a valid licence or with an expired/suspended
        licence.</li>
        <li>Fraud, misrepresentation of qualifications, or impersonation.</li>
        <li>Violation of patient privacy or confidentiality.</li>
        <li>Prescribing controlled substances without proper authorisation.</li>
        <li>Any conduct that poses a risk to patient safety or violates
        applicable law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Kynthai will investigate complaints promptly and may cooperate with
        medical regulatory authorities as required. Removal from the platform
        does not absolve a doctor of liability for their medical practice —
        patients retain the right to pursue claims directly against the
        treating doctor.
      </p>

        <p className="text-sm">
          <strong>Fee-splitting disclosure:</strong> The platform fee charged
          to doctors (15%) and labs (18%) is a service charge for technology
          infrastructure, scheduling, payment processing, and platform operations.
          It does not constitute a referral fee, commission, or division of
          professional fees between you and Kynthai. It does not constitute
          fee-sharing under applicable professional medical board regulations
          governing practitioners in their jurisdiction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Doctors pay a 15% platform fee on every consultation and medicine order
        routed through Kynthai (you keep 85%). Labs pay an 18% platform fee on
        every test booking fulfilled through the platform (you keep 82%).
        Platform fees are calculated on the pre-tax amount and deducted before
        payout. Loyalty tiers (Bronze → Platinum) reduce the fee by up to 3%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payouts are made on a Net-15 schedule (15 days after month-end) subject
        to a minimum payout threshold of $50 USD. Payouts are made via ACH, Wire, or direct deposit to your registered account. Withholding tax is
        deducted per applicable country tax law. Tax invoices are provided for reporting purposes. You are

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-refundable charges.</strong> Platform fees deducted from
        partner payouts are non-refundable once a consultation or order has been
        fulfilled. In-app purchases, if any, are final and non-refundable unless
        required by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cancellation for professional accounts.</strong> Doctors and

        the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, or if modification
        is not possible, severed from these Terms. The remaining provisions

        accessible for people with disabilities and user agents.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={FileText}>2. Current status</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai is working toward WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Some content may
        not yet fully conform due to third-party components or legacy features
        under active remediation. We commit to remediating known accessibility
        issues within 45 days of identification; critical issues (screen-reader
        blocking, keyboard navigation failures) are prioritised for remediation
        within 30 days.

        <li><strong>Color contrast:</strong> We target WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios for text and interactive elements where practical.</li>
        <li><strong>Resizable text:</strong> Content is legible at 200% zoom without loss of content or functionality.</li>

        Some third-party embedded content (e.g. AI chat models, payment iframes)
        may not be fully accessible. We work with our vendors to improve
        accessibility of embedded components and provide alternative access

      <SectionTitle icon={AlertTriangle}>1. Not a substitute for professional medical advice</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai is a health-management platform that provides tools for tracking
        medications, scheduling consultations, managing lab results, and
        accessing AI-powered health information. Kynthai does <strong>not</strong>
        provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. All AI-generated
        content is informational only and should not replace consultation with
        a qualified healthcare professional.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={AlertTriangle}>2. AI outputs are advisory only</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        AI features (chat, symptom analyzer, medicine identifier, drug
        interaction checker, prescription scanner) provide general
        information only. They are not substitutes for professional medical
        advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare
        professional before making any decisions about your health, medications,
        or treatment. Do not disregard or delay seeking professional medical
        advice because of something you read or received from Kynthai.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={AlertTriangle}>3. No doctor-patient relationship with Kynthai</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        Kynthai is a technology platform only. It is not a healthcare provider.
        Any advice, diagnosis, or treatment you receive through a doctor
        consultation on Kynthai comes from that independent doctor, not from
        Kynthai. Kynthai is not responsible for the quality, accuracy, or safety
        of any medical services provided by doctors on the platform.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={AlertTriangle}>4. Emergency numbers</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        In a medical emergency, contact your local emergency services immediately.
        Do not rely on Kynthai for emergency response.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>US:</strong> 911 (emergency)</li>
        <li><strong>EU/UK:</strong> 112</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Kynthai&apos;s Emergency SOS feature notifies your contacts and doctors,
        but it is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for emergency medical services.
      </p>

      <SectionTitle icon={Users}>5. Doctor consultations are independent</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        When you consult a doctor through Kynthai, you enter into a direct
        doctor-patient relationship with that <strong>independent practitioner</strong>.
        Kynthai is not responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment provided by the doctor.</li>
        <li>The accuracy or completeness of any prescription, test order, or medical recommendation.</li>
        <li>Any harm, injury, or damage resulting from the doctor&apos;s advice or treatment.</li>
      </ul>

      <SectionTitle icon={ShieldAlert}>6. Governing law </SectionTitle>
      <p>
        This disclaimer is governed by <strong>US federal law and the laws of the State of Wyoming, United States</strong>. Any
        dispute arising from your use of Kynthai&apos;s health features shall
        be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts in the State of
        <strong>Wyoming, United States</strong>, and the Terms of
        Service dispute resolution clause applies.
