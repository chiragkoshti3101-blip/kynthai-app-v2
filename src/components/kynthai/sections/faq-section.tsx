    },
    {
      q: 'Is my health data safe?',
      a: 'We design for privacy. Traffic uses TLS. Uploaded documents and prescription images are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). We do not sell your personal health data. You can request export or deletion from your account or by emailing privacy@kynthai.app.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Are you HIPAA compliant?',
      a: 'Kynthai is a consumer health app. We are not a HIPAA covered entity or business associate and do not claim HIPAA compliance. See our Privacy Policy for how we handle data under applicable US consumer privacy rules.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is it really free to start?',
      a: 'Yes. The Free plan includes a member profile, a limited set of medications and AI chats, and smart reminders. No credit card is required to sign up. Paid plans unlock more capacity when you need them.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What do paid plans cost?',
      a: 'Listed early pricing is in USD (for example Plus about $9.99/mo and Family Pro about $19.99/mo). Prices can change with notice. Cancel from your account when billing is active.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Are doctors on the platform verified?',
      a: 'When doctor listing is available, our team reviews credentials before access. A platform badge means our review was completed — doctors remain responsible for their own licenses with state boards.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
      a: 'Yes. When you have a paid subscription, cancel from your profile. You keep access through the end of the paid period where applicable.',
    },
    {
      q: "What if my doctor is not on Kynthai?",
      a: 'You can still use reminders, AI chat (health topics), and other patient tools. Invite your clinician when they are ready to join.',
